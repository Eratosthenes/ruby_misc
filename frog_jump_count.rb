  Problem: A small frog wants to get from position 0 to k (1 <= k <= 10,000). The frog can
  jump over any one of n fixed distances s0, s1, . . . , snâˆ’1 (1 <= si <= k). The goal is to count the
  number of different ways in which the frog can jump to position k. To avoid overflow, it is
  sufficient to return the result modulo q, where q is a given number.
